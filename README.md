# techtiles
Senior Design Project

Techtiles is a senior design project realized by a group of six in the University of Kentucky's class of 2022.
The objective of this project is to prototype and produce a floor tile capable of detecting the footprints of hospital patients, allowing a non-invasive method of monitoring said patients. 

This tile will gather data through reading pressure in the form of voltages at several points on the board, and organize these voltages into discrete readings, further organizing these readings into a string of 1s and 0s.
This string will then be wirelessly sent via WiFi to the end user, who receives the data through an app on the user's computer. This app will then process the string of data into an real-time image, and display every point where the pressure sensor detects pressure on the visual map.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a platform for collaboration on the programming side of things, and allow for version control.
